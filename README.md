# SchoolProject
Projects focus on how to employ data abstraction to build programs larger than those you constructed in basic C++ course. I learned how to use a variety of data structures in the course of solving problems, and importantly, how to analyze what data structures and algorithms are most appropriate for a given problem. In addition, I deepened my understanding of modern programming by learning the principles of object-oriented and generic programming. Language in C++.
